# asteroids

This is the first program I've ever written. It is basically a modded version of a tutorial I found on youtube so that I could have some hands on learning
while I take my Udemy JS courses. The ship, thruster and laser design and the explosion systems are my own creations replacing the code from the tutorial.

I might come back and try to some more stuff with it once I know more, but for now I need to actually learn web development.
